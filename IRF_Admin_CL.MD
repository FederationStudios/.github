# IRF Administration Changelog
This was created in an attempt to reduce the content of messages sent in the developer updates channels across IRF servers.

## IRF Administration - v1.2.0
Salutations, members of the IRF. The Administration bot has been updated and I'd like to address some changes.

### Fixes
- Added and fixed some options for `/request`
- Updated some code in `/report` and `/nsc_report`

## IRF Administration - v1.1.1
Salutations, members of the IRF. The Administration bot has been updated and I'd like to address some changes.

### Additions
- Fixed presence checking. If you're offline or your profile is private, it'll warn you of such (I expect this to break and be buggy, DM me if that happens)
- Added thumbnail pictures to `/check`, `/userid`, `/username`, and `/profile` so you know you're searching for the right user

### Fixes
- RoWifi has been stabilised so there shouldn't be unnecessary warnings about it saying you're not verified when you are
- Fixed an annoying bug where the ban reason duplicated itself
